# Witness Tree Project (WTP)

## Overview

The **Witness Tree Project (WTP)** is a long-term environmental monitoring programme based at **Trinity College Botanic Garden (TCBG), Dublin**, designed to quantify how woody plants respond physiologically to climate change and urban environmental pressures. The project treats selected trees as long-lived, repeatedly measured “witnesses” of environmental change within a common garden setting.

WTP is explicitly conceived as a **>30-year monitoring programme**, integrating plant ecophysiology, atmospheric pollution research, teaching, and public engagement to scientifically inform nation urban forestry policy. All protocols, data, and derived products are developed under open-science principles to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and long-term continuity beyond individual researchers.

## Scientific Rationale

Botanic gardens hold diverse living collections growing under shared environmental conditions, offering a unique opportunity to:

* Compare physiological responses across phylogenetically and biogeographically diverse species
* Detect early signals of climate stress and resilience in woody plants
* Quantify ecosystem services provided by urban trees, including air pollution mitigation
* Generate long-term datasets that are otherwise extremely rare in plant and urban ecology

Despite this potential, fewer than 1% of botanic gardens globally operate long-term (>3 year) monitoring programmes using their living collections. WTP was established to address this gap and to provide a transferable framework for similar initiatives worldwide.

## Core Research Questions

WTP addresses questions including:

* How does stomatal conductance vary across species under shared climatic conditions?
* Which tree species are more resilient or vulnerable to increasing temperature, altered humidity, and urban stressors?
* How effectively do different leaf morphologies and species intercept particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)?
* How do physiological traits scale from leaf-level measurements to ecosystem services relevant for urban planning?

As the programme matures, additional variables will allow investigation of:

* Water-use efficiency (via stable carbon isotopes)
* Photosynthetic performance and stress (chlorophyll fluorescence)
* Pigment content and senescence dynamics
* Long-term growth, health, and legacy effects archived through herbarium vouchers

## Witness Trees

"Witness trees" are permanently tagged individual specimens selected using explicit criteria:

* Phylogenetic breadth (angiosperms, gymnosperms, monocots)
* Ecological and biogeographic diversity
* Cultural, ethnobotanical, or conservation significance
* Relevance to urban forestry and climate adaptation
* Representation of both well-studied and under-studied taxa

Each witness tree is measured repeatedly through time, generating internally consistent time series that allow robust interspecific comparison.

## Data Collected

### 1. Stomatal Conductance (Porometry)

Leaf-level measurements following a standardised protocol:

* Repeated over consecutive days
* Multiple leaf replicates per individual
* Accompanied by leaf orientation, light environment, and microclimate data

Primary variable:

* `gs` (stomatal conductance; mmol m⁻² s⁻¹)

Supporting variables include leaf PAR, relative humidity, temperature, sun exposure, and qualitative leaf condition.

---

### 2. Particulate Matter Deposition (PM)

Laboratory-based analysis of particles deposited on leaf surfaces:

* PM2.5 and PM10 classification
* Particle size, shape, and area
* Elemental composition via SEM–EDS

This dataset links species traits to their capacity to intercept and retain airborne pollutants in an urban environment.

---

### 3. Stable Isotopes

Leaf tissue is archived and analysed for stable carbon isotopes to quantify **intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE)** and longer-term physiological integration of environmental conditions.

* δ¹³C of leaf material
* Inference of time-integrated stomatal behaviour
* Linkage between short-term porometry measurements and seasonal-scale water-use strategies

Isotope data provide a bridge between instantaneous gas-exchange measurements and longer-term plant functional responses.

---

### 4. Chlorophyll Content and Photosynthetic Status

Non-destructive measurements are used to assess leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic condition:

* Chlorophyll content (SPAD or equivalent optical indices)
* Indicators of leaf nitrogen status and senescence
* Repeated measures to track seasonal and interannual trends

These measurements contextualise stomatal behaviour within overall photosynthetic capacity.

---

### 5. Leaf Traits

Key leaf functional traits are recorded to support trait-based interpretation and cross-species comparison:

* Leaf area and morphology
* Leaf thickness and structural attributes
* Qualitative and quantitative indicators of leaf condition

Trait data enable integration of WTP measurements with global trait databases and support scaling from leaf physiology to ecosystem function.

---

### 6. Meteorological Context

Meteorological data from the on-site TCBG weather station are used to contextualise physiological measurements, including:

* Air temperature
* Relative humidity
* Radiation and PAR
* Wind speed and direction
* Precipitation

---

## Open Science and Data Management

WTP is designed to be **FAIR-compliant** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable):

* Protocols are versioned and published with DOIs
* Raw and processed datasets are archived in open repositories
* Metadata accompany all datasets
* Code used for processing and visualisation is version-controlled

---

## Teaching and Outreach

The Witness Tree Project functions as a **living laboratory**:

* Integrated into undergraduate teaching in field skills, soil science, and mycology
* Generates herbarium voucher specimens for long-term archival
* Produces public-facing materials, infographics, and garden signage
* Supports dialogue between researchers, students, and garden visitors on climate change and urban ecology

---

## Governance and Continuity

Given its intended multi-decadal lifespan, WTP emphasises:

* Clear documentation over individual ownership
* Modular, updateable protocols
* Institutional embedding within Trinity College Botanic Garden
* Transferability of methods to other botanic gardens and arboreta

This design ensures that the project remains scientifically valuable even as personnel change.
